\section{Conclusion}

We present \chameleon{}, a type debugging tool for the Haskell programming language. \chameleon{} facilitates a constraint-based type inference back end that provides accurate and comprehensive type error reports. \chameleon{} also facilitates an interactive front end with three different display modes, enabling programmers to navigate deep type relations and triangulate conflicting statements in source code. Four participatory experiments were conducted to evaluate the tool's design with programmers with varied experiences. We found that, particularly for more complex tasks, \chameleon{} helped programmers to fix type errors more quickly than traditional text-based error messages.  Further, programmers actively using \chameleon{} interactive features are shown to be more efficient in fixing type errors than simply reading the type error output.
